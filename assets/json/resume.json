      "summary": "This article explores the rise and fall of the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) in Thailand, using it as a case study to illustrate the challenges that transitional military regimes face in retaining power through electoral means. The PPRP’s initial success at the ballot was heavily dependent on patronage politics, which, while effective in the short term, ultimately contributed to its downfall. Local elites who managed these patronage networks were not merely passive allies; they actively leveraged their affiliation with the PPRP to solidify their own local power bases instead of the party’s institutional capacity. Their loyalty was not to the party but to the resources and opportunities the party provided. This dynamic weakened the PPRP’s ability to consolidate power at the national level, leading to internal divisions that eroded its effectiveness in maintaining the military regime’s political dominance amid pressures for democratization. The article concludes that the organizational weaknesses of parties such as the PPRP undermine both authoritarian resilience and the prospects for democratic consolidation, compelling regime stakeholders to adopt strategies that, in Thailand’s case, further destabilize political institutions."

      "summary": "Relying on data from an original survey collected the week before and the week after Thailand’s 14 May 2023 general election, as well as observations from fieldwork, this article identifies two political cleavages that were influential in shaping vote choice: age and ideology. Younger voters and those who embrace more liberal values were significantly more likely to support the Move Forward. Nevertheless, we caution that this election may be unique, and that these political cleavages may not necessarily drive voter behaviour in future elections."
