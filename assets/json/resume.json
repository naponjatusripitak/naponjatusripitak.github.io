and the week after Thailand’s 14 May 2023 general election, as well as observations from fieldwork, this article identifies two political cleavages that were influential in shaping vote choice: age and ideology. Younger voters and those who embrace more liberal values were significantly more likely to support the Move Forward. Nevertheless, we caution that this election may be unique, and that these political cleavages may not necessarily drive voter behaviour in future elections."},{"name":"A New Tale of Two Democracies?
